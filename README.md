# Election Analysis



## Overview of Election Audit
We've been hired to create a Python script for Tom to use in his audit of a Colorado congressional district. We've been given many Python code tasks, including counting the number of votes, the proportion of votes for each candidate, the number of votes for each candidate, and the winner.

We started with the candidate measures, but Tom's manager loved them so much that he now wants us to focus on "county" data. This has previously been done in Excel, but Tom's manager wants to automate it in the future if this works. If this succeeds, it will be used in other sorts of elections in the future.


## Election Audit Results
The analysis of the election shows that: There were 369,711 total votes cast in this congressional election. The counties results: Jefferson county had 10.5% of the total vote with 38,855 votes. Denver county had 82.8% of the total vote with 306,055 votes. Arapahoe county had 6.7% of the total vote with 24,801 votes. Denver county had the largest number of votes. The candidate results: Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes. Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes. Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes. The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

 
  

## Election Audit Summary
This script with modifications can be modified to audit anything from PTO to presidential elections and from the prom court to the county fair royalty. 
1. Columns could be added, and others removed in the table (Excel spreadsheet) so that this could be used to work for a school board election. To do this you would need to be able to create new lists, dictionaries, etc. depending on the output you want.
2. You could also make the Python script more complicated by adding columns and expected outcomes for every position on the ballet being cast, no matter the jurisdiction. For example, the president, a governor, congress, a judge and school board member may all appear on the same ballot, but all represent different geographic/demographic areas. In doing this you would need to create new lists, dictionaries, etc. Depending on the number of position types being filled on the ballot. The code could become very long.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Troubleshooting problems discovered was a common problem for myself when we were first starting out with Python. When the code editor told you where the error occurred, it was fantastic, but other times the problem may be on another line. There were additional instances when an issue wouldn't generate an error, yet it was evident that the program wasn't doing what was expected. Research and help from peers saved the day.
